    <h1>About Code-Vengers</h1>
    <p>
    Hello we are Maria Moreno, Richard Baylis, and William Lan also known as The Code-Vengers!! We are a group of self-driven, hard working and  quick learning individuals who love to challenge ourselves and use the latest technologies..... and that was our inspiration to create a game! We pushed ourselves not only to use software we know such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React-JS, node, JSON, but learn new software like Unity and C#. Together as a team we challenged, helped and supported each other to create “Type Knight”. We truly hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!!
